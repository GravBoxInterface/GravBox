# GravBox
## PROJECT SYNOPSIS

GravBox is the interface application for the Augmented Reality (AR) Sandbox for gravitational dynamics simulations designed and built at the University of Iowa by Dr. Hai Fu\'s 2016-2017 Introduction to Astrophysics class. The GravBox application was developed by Zachary Luppen, Erin Maier, and Mason Reed. The sandbox was designed and built by Wyatt Bettis, Ross McCurdy, and Sadie Moore. The gravitational algorithm was written by Sophie Deam, Jacob Isbell, and Jianbo Lu. Graphic design was contributed by Jeremy Swanston. The original AR Sandbox is the result of an NSF-funded project on informal science education for freshwater lake and watershed science developed by the UC Davis' W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences, together with the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, Lawrence Hall of Science, and ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center.

## RESOURCES FOR USING GRAVBOX

A tablet is used for interaction and input on the AR Sandbox device. The tablet is a Samsung Galaxy Tab A, with a 1920x1200 pixel ratio. After the password to the tablet is entered, the kivy launcher app is located on the home screen. When pressed, it opens up all of the kivy apps currently saved on the tablet. Tapping on the Gravbox app opens it. The app works by having the user input the speed and direction of a particle from the starting location of their choice, and then having it interact with the topography created by the sand and read in by the Kinect. A user simply drags their finger across the screen to decide the particle's location, speed and direction. Location is determined by where the user initially places their finger. Speed is indicated by how long the vector is, which has a maximum length built into the app. Direction is indicated by where the user moves their finger, and is updated in real-time as the user moves their finger across the screen, allowing them to pick what direction they want. Once the user lifts their finger from the screen, this data is automatically written into a .txt file, which the gravity algorithm detects and reads in.



### KIVY

KIVY is a Python module used for making Android apps. It requires the user to download and install, ensuring that the user's method of programming in Python can import it. The module itself is made up of a vast collection of tools, properties and object-oriented programming to create applications. Countless examples of source code and answered questions are available online, so it's up to the user to discover all of the utilities. In general, it's very simple to import various modules the user requires in order to create an app. All a user needs to do to test the functionality is run the python file, and as long as everything is installed properly, an emulation window should open displaying the app.

### BUILDOZER

When an app is ready to be turned into an .apk file, the only real method to go about doing it is to use Buildozer. Buildozer is used to create application packages, which are then downloaded and installed on a device. Buildozer can be installed on a Linux machine. To install Buildozer, follow the steps here: https://github.com/kivy/buildozer . Once it is properly installed, a user must do the following:

type 'buildozer init', press enter, this will create a file called buildozer.spec
Use the built-in vim text editor (or another text editor) and make these changes to the buildozer.spec file:

type 'buildozer android debug', press enter, this generates the .apk file that can then be transferred over to an Android device and installed.

### KIVY LAUNCHER

If the app requires debugging, as most do, then using kivy launcher is the way to go. Simply install the Kivy Launcher app from the app store onto your device. To run apps, it requires the .py file for the app and any required images or .gifs to be placed in the root folder. Once they are in, open the Kivy Launcher app and the created application should appear on its screen. 

### PYTHON

We use version 2.7 of Python for the app. Any further changes to the code need to be written in Python 2.7. Buildozer supports both Python 2.7 and 3.5, but as long as the version setting in the buildozer.spec file is set to 3.5, the code will compile into a .apk file correctly.
