# GravBox
## PROJECT SYNOPSIS

GravBox is the interface application for the Augmented Reality (AR) Sandbox for gravitational dynamics simulations designed and built at the University of Iowa by Dr. Hai Fu\'s 2016-2017 Introduction to Astrophysics class. The GravBox application was developed by Zachary Luppen, Erin Maier, and Mason Reed. The sandbox was designed and built by Wyatt Bettis, Ross McCurdy, and Sadie Moore. The gravitational algorithm was written by Sophie Deam, Jacob Isbell, and Jianbo Lu. Graphic design was contributed by Jeremy Swanston. The original AR Sandbox is the result of an NSF-funded project on informal science education for freshwater lake and watershed science developed by the UC Davis' W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences, together with the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, Lawrence Hall of Science, and ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center.
